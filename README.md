Aki is a wimpy kid. Seriously? Is he lazy? Not at all! 
He always keeps asking, 'How to get the freaking question papers?'. He is in search of his Question papers for T1 and sick of clicking numerous folders for hours on the boring dot6 space. Boom! He got an idea. He started to search the question papers from the search bar. He went to dot6. Wow! What a beautiful place it is! He found the Question paper and checked department semesters, examinations, found out the matching one, and finally, he solved the paper. 

But, alas! He was late. The another stud who had a better access, solved papers much before. Aki asked him, 'Bro, how did you find it earlier?'. He replied, 'Use **metaQP** kid!'.

### Development

**Host machine**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/akhilesh-k/metaqp.git

$ http-server metaqp
```

### Pretty printing `data.json`

You can use any JSON utility that is installed on your computer.
[`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is recommended.

```sh
$ jq '' data/data.json > data/data2.json
$ mv data/data2.json data/data.json
```
